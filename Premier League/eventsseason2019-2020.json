League","strSeason":"2019-2020","strDescriptionEN":"Jannik Vestergaard's towering header gave 10-man Southampton a point after another moment of magic from Manchester United new boy Daniel James looked to have put them on course for victory at St Mary's.\r\n\r\nJames scored his third Premier League goal in four appearances with a fierce, rising right-foot drive after only 10 minutes, and the 21-year-old Wales attacker was the biggest threat for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.\r\n\r\nSaints, however, gained momentum in the second half as a disappointing United side grew increasingly sloppy, and Vestergaard capped a spell of pressure with the equaliser just before the hour.\r\n\r\nChe Adams had blazed wide of an open goal and David de Gea had saved superbly from Danny Ings before the giant figure of Vestergaard rose to meet Kevin Danso's fine cross.\r\n\r\nIt proved the high point of Danso's afternoon as he was then sent off for a crude lunge at Scott McTominay when he was already on a yellow card, leaving referee Mike Dean with an easy decision.\r\n\r\nUnited, predictably, laid siege to Southampton's goal in the closing stages but were kept out as keeper Angus Gunn saved superbly from Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood, while both Jesse Lingaard and Ashley Young were just off target.\r\n\r\nIt leaves the Old Trafford side with only one win from four league games, the opening-day win against Chelsea being followed by draws here and at Wolves and that home defeat by Crystal Palace.","strHomeTeam":"Southampton","strAwayTeam":"Manchester

looked to be in complete control when Christian Eriksen pounced to put them ahead in the 10th minute after Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno pushed out Erik Lamela's shot.\r\n\r\nLeno then saved superbly from Son Heung-min before the South Korean was senselessly hacked down in the area by Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka to allow Harry Kane to score his 10th goal in 11 derby games.\r\n\r\nArsenal started the revival when Alexandre Lacazette pulled one back on the stroke of half-time before they laid siege to Spurs' goal after the break.\r\n\r\nSpurs keeper Hugo Lloris saved superbly from Matteo Guendozi's low shot and from substitute Dani Ceballos before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang showed the poacher's instinct to turn home the equaliser with 19 minutes remaining.\r\n\r\nKane struck the inside of the post and Sokratis had a goal ruled out for offside - Spurs also had strong penalty claims rejected when the pair clashed late on - but neither side could make the decisive breakthrough and this entertaining encounter ended with honours even.\r\n\r\nThe result lifts Arsenal to fifth in the Premier League with seven points from four games, while Tottenham head into September's international break four places behind their rivals in ninth on five points.\r\n\r\nSpurs will be disappointed at only getting a draw after establishing such a position of strength at 2-0 but in the end there was almost a sense they should be grateful for a point.","strHomeTeam":"Arsenal","strAwayTeam":"Tottenham","intHomeScore":"2","intRound":"4","intAwayScore":"2","intSpectators":null,"strOfficial":null,"strTimestamp":"2019-09-01T15:30:00+00:00","dateEvent":"2019-09-01","dateEventLocal":null,"strTime":"15:30:00","strTimeLocal":"16:30:00","strTVStation":null,"idHomeTeam":"133604","idAwayTeam":"133616","intScore":null,"intScoreVotes":null,"strResult":"","strVenue":"Emirates

Ryan Bertrand of Southampton was dismissed for a studs-up challenge in the build-up to the goal, confirmed by VAR, two minutes later. Leicester were 3–0 up by the 19th minute, thanks to Youri Tielemans and Ayoze Pérez. Pérez added the fourth on the 39th minute, with Jamie Vardy scoring on the stroke of half-time to send Leicester into the break ahead 5–0. Pérez completed his hat-trick on the 57th minute, with Vardy adding his second and Leicester's seventh a minute later. James Maddison scored a 85th minute free-kick before Jamie Vardy completed his own hat-trick with a penalty four minutes into stoppage time. The final whistle blasted after the penalty was made. It was only the second time in Premier League history that two players scored a hat-trick for one team in the same game, last coming in an Arsenal 6–1 win over Southampton on 7 May 2003 with Jermaine Pennant and Robert Pires scoring three goals apiece.\r\n\r\nFrom
